# AI Assistance Disclosure

## Transparency Statement

This repository (Flytrap) has been built and is maintained with the assistance of various AI/LLM coding agents. We believe in transparency about the tools and technologies used in our development process.

## AI Models and Agents Used

### Primary Development Assistant

- **GitHub Copilot**
  - AI-powered code completion and intelligent code suggestions
  - Assisted with code generation, refactoring, and problem-solving
  - Helped with GitHub-specific workflows and repository management

- **Anthropic's Claude Code** (claude.ai/code)
  - Used for initial project setup, architecture design, and ongoing code development
  - Assisted with Python code generation, debugging, and documentation
  - Helped implement complex features like SRT streaming, YOLO11 integration, and real-time object tracking

- **OpenCode's Big Pickle**
  - Contributed to code optimization and performance improvements
  - Assisted with testing strategies and CI/CD pipeline configuration

- **Grok Code Fast 1**
  - Helped with algorithm design and computer vision model selection
  - Contributed to documentation writing and technical content creation

- **Code Supernova Model (No Longer Available)**
  - Assisted with infrastructure setup and deployment configurations
  - Helped with security best practices and code review processes

## How AI Was Used

### Development Activities
- **Code Generation**: AI agents helped write initial implementations and boilerplate code
- **Architecture Design**: AI provided guidance on system architecture and design patterns
- **Debugging**: AI assisted in identifying and fixing bugs in the codebase
- **Documentation**: AI helped create comprehensive documentation and user guides
- **Testing**: AI contributed to test case development and quality assurance strategies

### Code Quality and Maintenance
- **Code Reviews**: AI agents performed initial code reviews and suggested improvements
- **Refactoring**: AI helped identify opportunities for code optimization and restructuring
- **Documentation Updates**: AI assisted in keeping documentation current and comprehensive

## Human Oversight and Verification

While AI tools played a significant role in development, all code and decisions underwent human review and verification:

- **Final Code Review**: All AI-generated code was reviewed by human developers
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing was performed to ensure functionality and reliability
- **Security Review**: Code was audited for security best practices
- **Documentation Verification**: All documentation was verified for accuracy and completeness

## AI Tool Capabilities and Limitations

We acknowledge that AI coding assistants have certain capabilities and limitations:

### Capabilities
- Rapid code generation and prototyping
- Knowledge of best practices and design patterns
- Ability to work with large codebases
- Multi-language support and framework knowledge

### Limitations
- May not fully understand complex business logic
- Can make assumptions that need human verification
- May not have access to the latest documentation or updates
- Should be used as a tool to augment, not replace, human expertise

## Commitment to Quality

Despite using AI assistance, we maintain the same standards of code quality, security, and reliability as any professionally developed software project. All AI-generated content is reviewed, tested, and validated by human developers before being included in the repository.
