## Why Choose YOLO11m for Most Computer Vision Tasks?

**YOLO11m** (the "medium" variant) is generally the best starting point for object detection and related vision workloads. It strikes a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and hardware compatibility, making it an ideal default across diverse applications and environments.

### Key Reasons to Use YOLO11m

- **High Accuracy with Efficient Size:**  
  YOLO11m achieves state-of-the-art mean Average Precision (mAP) on benchmarks (e.g., COCO, custom datasets) while using 22% fewer parameters than earlier models like YOLOv8m. This means better results with less compute and memory required.

- **Cross-Platform Flexibility:**  
  The model fits comfortably on modern affordable GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3080/3090), Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M4), and a wide range of CPUs. It is optimized for real-time speeds on edge devices, desktops, and high-performance servers alike.

- **Optimal Resource Utilization:**  
  YOLO11m offers a favorable accuracy-to-memory trade-off: expect reliable 30–60 FPS at standard (640px) resolutions and support for batch processing without exceeding GPU or system RAM limits for most contemporary hardware. Larger models (YOLO11l/x) consume much more memory with only modest accuracy gains, while smaller models (YOLO11n/s) trade off too much precision for speed.

- **Scalability for Multi-Stream and Batch Inference:**  
  CoreML, TensorRT, and ONNX exports for YOLO11m are supported and perform well in production, allowing multiple concurrent video streams or batch-processing pipelines, all with routine hardware.

- **Versatile Supported Tasks:**  
  YOLO11m is not limited to object detection—instance segmentation, image classification, pose/keypoint estimation, and oriented object detection are all supported out-of-the box.

### Example Use Cases

- Real-time detection tasks (NDI, RTSP, webcam, etc.)
- Multi-stream deployments (surveillance, traffic analytics, broadcast media)
- Bulk image/video inference on local servers or cloud
- Edge AI (IoT, robotics, embedded platforms)
- Research and rapid prototyping with standard hardware

### Practical Guidance

- For most projects, **start with YOLO11m** and tune hyperparameters as needed.  
- If hardware constraints or extreme speed are required (e.g., mobile, microcontrollers), consider YOLO11s or YOLO11n.  
- For ultra-high accuracy and abundant compute, YOLO11l or YOLO11x may be considered, but these generally have diminishing returns for their increased resource cost.

Use YOLO11m for a great balance of speed, accuracy, and system compatibility.
